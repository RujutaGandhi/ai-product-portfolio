## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Framework Selection

Automatically determines the appropriate analysis model based on user input.

### 🚦 Clarification Gate

When prompts are vague, the system:

* Pauses generation
* Requests 2–3 specific details
* Ensures structured, high-quality outputs

### 🗂 Dynamic Analysis Tabs

Only relevant frameworks are displayed, reducing cognitive overload.

### 🛡 Server-Side Rate Limiting

* 10 requests per day (global cap)
* Prevents API abuse
* Controls operational costs

### 📱 Mobile-First Optimization

* Auto-expanding input field
* Responsive layout
* Designed for decision-making on the go
